A brief explanation of this project and its end goal.

I try to predict the EURO-USD exchange rate for a given period of time. In order to do so, I am also interested in seeing how external factors have an effect on this exchange rate, such as GDP of the USA, inflation rate, Unemployment rate of the US and several other factors. 

This is the first part of the project, using external regressors and train my model in order to predict future exchange rate for a given period. 

The second part is to introduce sentiment analysis, meaning to see if news articles do have an effect on the exchange rate, by effect I mean would positive articles for example have a relation with an increase in the exchange rate or not. 

The idea is to try two approaches:
- First approach is to perform prediction using the external regressors specified excluding sentiment regressor.
- Second approach is to perform prediction using the external regressors specified including sentiment regressor.

Then see which approach leads to a better performance/prediciton.
